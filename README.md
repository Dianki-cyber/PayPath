 Accounting Ledger – Capstone Project 1

 Project Description
This Java console application simulates an **accounting ledger system**.  
Users can record, view, and filter financial transactions such as deposits, payments, sales, and refunds.  
All records are saved in a `.csv` file, so data stays persistent between runs.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of:
- Java classes and objects  
- File I/O (CSV read/write)  
- Conditional statements, loops, and methods  
- Switch-case menus and user input  
- Git version control and documentation

---
